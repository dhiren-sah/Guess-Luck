# Guess-Luck
GuessLuck is a simple console-based number guessing game built for fun and practice. The user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range, and the program gives feedback after each guess. Itâ€™s a great beginner-friendly project to understand conditionals, loops, and basic input/output in programming.
